# Semantic-Segmentation-Problem-

Implemented a deep learning model for semantic segmentation using the Cambridge Labeled Objects in Video Dataset.
Utilized the FCN16 model architecture to achieve accurate object detection and segmentation.
Preprocessed the dataset, including extracting and resizing images, and normalizing pixel values.
Trained the model using a pretrained weights approach, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the test set.
Evaluated the model's performance using metrics such as Intersection over Union (IoU) and Mean Intersection over Union (mIoU).
Presented the project outcomes to the project team and received positive feedback on the results achieved.
